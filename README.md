# hello-world
This is my first git project.

So far so good. I'm required to write a brief description about myself so here goes.

I love pancakes. In fact I just had some about an hour ago. And I still plan to have lunch.
Meanwhile, I'm working on a few dopeass projects. Hoping to make the world a much better place.
